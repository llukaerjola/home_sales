# home_sales
Module 22 Challenge
This project serves to determind key metrics about home sales data. Then, Spark is utilized to create temporary views, partition the data, cache and uncache a temporary table, and verify that the table has been uncached.
Some of the questions that were answered by using SparkSQL:

What is the average price for a four-bedroom house sold for each year?

What is the average price of a home for each year it was built that has three bedrooms and three bathrooms?

What is the average price of a home for each year that has three bedrooms, three bathrooms, two floors, and is greater than or equal to 2,000 square feet?

What is the "view" rating for homes costing more than or equal to $350,000?

Overall, this project demonstrated the usage of SparkSQL to read, query, cache, and analyze home sales data, providing insights into average prices based on various criteria.
